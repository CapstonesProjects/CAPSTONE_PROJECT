                <p>An examination is being given to high school graduates whose grades in all subjects during the 4th grading period of their last year
                in high school are not lower than 85%. However, consideration is being given to students who have a single grade lower than 85%
                in a particular subject while the remaining subjects fully compensate for the deficit.</p>

            <p>If he/she scores 84 points below, the minimum discount will automatically be given to any student who took the initiative to
            take the examination. This scholarship grant is good for 1 semester only.</p>
