                <p>Entrance Scholarships (For New Students) - are extended to valedictorians</br> 
                and salutatorians of all secondary schools recognized by the Department of Education. An</br>
                academic Scholarship intended for new students is a scholarship grant given to</br> 
                incoming freshmen.</p>
                <p>An examination is being given to high school graduates whose grades in all subjects</br> 
                during the 4th grading period of their last year in high school are not lower than 85%. </br> 
                However, consideration is being given to students who have a single grade lower than 85% </br> 
                in a particular subject while the remaining subjects fully compensate for the deficit. In such </br> 
                cases, the Accounting Office verbally informs the applicant that he/she will be allowed to</br> 
                take the scholarship exam, provided that his/her raw score shall not be lower than 84 points</br> </p>
                <p>If he/she scores 84 points below, the minimum discount will automatically be given to</br> 
                any student who took the initiative to take the examination. This scholarship grant is good</br> 
                for 1 semester only.</p>
